this symfony bundle allows you to manage DNS zones and records through a web interface.If you have already installed and configured Powerdns properly, following the steps below will be all that is required
Now you can run install.sh and both powerdns and its web interface will be installed and configured automatically 
```console
bash install.sh
```

the installing script is only tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and it is likely that you need to modify it to make it work with other versions
